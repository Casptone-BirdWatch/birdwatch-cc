<h1 align="center"> Cloud BirdWatch Documentation </h1>
Welcome to the official documentation for BirdWatch! Here you'll find everything you need to know about integrating, deploying, and utilizing our bird classification system.

## Cloud Architecture
Our architecture leverages Cloud Run for deploying our ML model (Flask) and Backend (Express.js), Cloud Storage for storing user-uploaded photos, and Firestore for persisting prediction results. This setup ensures efficient deployment, scalable storage, and reliable data management to support our application seamlessly.
